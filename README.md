**The Reading Room**
<hr></hr>

"The Reading Room" is a library and creative writing app that allows the user to log, review and share books they are reading and create their own original work.


In the Library section, users can log and review books, and also peruse suggesstions for new finds from the NYT Bestseller list. In the Writing section, the app provides text and visual writing prompts to inspire users to create and share their own original work, as well as an imbedded richtext editor to allow them to write within the app or paste work created in other programs so they can be saved and shared online.


Finally, it allows users to see the library and reviews of other users, and allows users to give feedback on original work.
