**The Reading Room**
<hr></hr>

"The Reading Room" is a library and creative writing app that allows the user to log, review and share books they are reading and create their own original work.

When the app loads the Home view, the user can peruse suggesstions for new finds from the NYT Bestseller list


In the Library section, users can log books and indicate if they have read them or if they are still "on the pile" (i.e. in the wait to be read pile). 


In the Writing section, the app provides text and visual writing prompts to inspire users to create and share their own original work, as well as an imbedded richtext editor to allow them to write within the app or paste work created in other programs so they can be saved and shared online(in progress).


Finally, it allows users to see the library and reviews of other users, and allows users to give feedback on original work(in progress).

**Next Steps**
- complete CRUD functionality, allowing users to update and delete books added to their library
- save functionality available in the text editor, currently all text is saved in state and not able to be exported
- allow for multiple users to view data of other users by enabling a public or private view state 
- allow users to 'publish' work online, and for other users to give feedback (i.e. reviews)
